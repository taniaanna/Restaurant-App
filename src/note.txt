                  ------------------------------
              - Basic Commands in Angular
              1. ng new project-name - for creating a project in Angular

              2. ng serve --open - to run angular project

              3. ng g c component-name - to generate component

              4. To generate Service - ng g s service-name

              5. To create pipe - ng g p pipe-name


        -Basic Concepts in Angular
        1. Module - to import 3rd party libraries - Root Module - AppModule

        2. Component - generate html, css, ts - Root Component - AppComponent

        3. To set up path for component - use AppRoutingModule(app.routes.ts)
            -syntax:{path:'path name',component:Component-name} inside Routes Array in AppRoutingModule(app.routes.ts)

        4. Selectors - replace it with corresponding component html page

        5. Router-outlet selector - to display the html in browser according to user request

        6. Angular Service - Reusable code and can be shared across components

        7. Dependency Injection - to share data between dependent classes
            -syntax : access-specifier variable-name:dependent-class-name
            -access specifier- public/private/protected
            -inside constructor of a class

        8. Asynchronous Function - Observable - rxjs library- react extends to javascript
            -resolve state - subscribe()
            -reject state - catch()

        9. Data Binding - To share data within a component
             9.1 One way Binding - Sharing done in only one direction at a time
                9.1.1 component(ts) to view(html)
                    9.1.1.1 String Interpolation - syntax: {{property-name}} in html
                    9.1.1.2 Property Binding - syntax: [attribute-name]="property-name" in html
                    
                9.1.2 view(html) to component(ts)
                    9.1.2.1 Event Binding -(event-name)="function call()"
                    9.1.2.2 Event Binding using $event - (event-name)="function call($event)" 

             9.2 Two way Binding - share only in two direction at a time
               9.2.1 ngModel - Import FormsModule, [(ngModel)]="property-name"       
                       
        10. Angular Directive - To manipulate DOM
               10.1 Component Directive 
               10.2 Structural Directive - to add/remove html elements based on some condition
                                           /length of an Array
                    10.2.1 *ngIf="condition"
                    10.2.2 *ngFor="let variable-name of array-name"
               10.3 Attribute Directive - based on some value/class property we can 
                                      set style of html elements

        11.ActivatedRoute - Provides access to information about a route associated with a 
                            component that is loaded in an outlet

        12. ngForm - to track the form values 

        13.Pipe - Use pipes to transform strings, currency amounts, dates, 
                      and other data for display.
        
        14.BehaviorSubject - used which acts as a single store to hold updated shared data
